		Looking for the XView libraries ... not found
		WAVE will not be compiled, because the XView libraries do not

		To compile WAVE, install XView, add the directory containing the
		XView textedit application to your PATH, and run ./configure again.
		
		IMPORTANT: You have chosen to build a dynamic (shared) WFDB library in
		a directory, /usr/local/bin, that is not normally searched for such
		libraries.  In order to use the applications that will be compiled
		with this library, it may be necessary to add this directory to your
		LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  If your shell is csh or a variant, do this by
		typing:
		  setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/bin
		Otherwise, do this by typing:
		  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/bin
		  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
		
		Summary:
		
		wfdb-10.7.0-cygwin is now ready to be compiled using 'gcc'.
		The WFDB library will be compiled as a dynamic library with NETFILES
		 access via libcurl, and it will be installed in '/usr/local/bin'.
		The WFDB library .h files will be installed in '/usr/local/include/wfdb'.
		The WFDB applications will be linked to dynamic system libraries, and
		 they will be installed in '/usr/local/bin'.
		WAVE will not be compiled.
		'.nual pages will be installed in subdirectories of '/usr/local/man
		Sample data files will be installed in '/usr/local/database', which
		 will be included in the default WFDB path.
		
		If you need to compile a different WFDB library type, or install into different
		directories, rerun this script with its "-i" (interactive) option:
		      ./configure -i
		Other options can be viewed by rerunning this script with its "-h" option:
		      ./configure -h
		
		WFDB software configuration is complete.
		Now run 'make' to compile and test, followed by 'make install' to recompile
		and install the software, man pages, and example data.  Finally, run
		'make check' to verify that the installation is complete and successful.
